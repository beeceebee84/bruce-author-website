      <p class="first-letter:text-5xl first-letter:font-display first-letter:text-ember-400 first-letter:mr-2 first-letter:float-left">
        When I first arrived in Montego Bay, the energy was electric. The streets were alive with <em>music and movement</em>. There were several clubs, including the well-known 2727, a Margaritaville nearby, and a few casinos open around the clock.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I wandered, I came across a man selling Campari and rum on the street. His name was <strong class="text-ember-400">Troy</strong>.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-ember-500/70 pl-4 italic text-bone-50/80">
        “Wah gwaan, boss? Mi have di best ting ya need,” he said, tone sharp and inviting as he held up bottles.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Troy was a hustler—the kind who could get you anything: women, drugs, drinks, you name it. <strong>“Anything yuh waan, mi sort it out.”</strong></p>

      <p>We started talking, and soon we were throwing back shots — Wray &amp; Nephew, Appleton, even Campari mixed with rum, a bitter concoction Troy swore by. The drink itself wasn’t great, but the moment made it unforgettable.</p>

      <p>He asked about America; I asked about Jamaica. His view of my country made me reflect on <em>my own sense of identity — or lack thereof.</em>  
      Being Black in America feels different, like the culture is fragmented. But in places like Jamaica or Brazil, there’s a deep sense of belonging I envied.</p>

      <p>After a while, Troy offered to take me to Club 2727. “Mi know di owner. Mi get yuh in easy,” he said. True to his word, he hooked me up with a table and drinks. The club was packed, the music pounding. <strong>Spice</strong> was there—not performing but vibing with friends in VIP. Thanks to Troy, I was close enough to feel the bass in my bones.</p>

      <p>When I left the club, Troy was still outside, shouting, “<strong class="text-ember-400">Jefe! Big boss!</strong>” And that’s when I saw her.</p>

      <blockquote class="my-6 p-5 bg-ink-800/60 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <p class="italic">
          A woman stood nearby, eyes locked on me. She didn’t look away. After a moment, I called out: “Why you lookin’ at me like that?”
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-right text-ember-400">“Yuh look like somebody worth lookin’ at.”</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>And just like that, I met Jovel.</strong></p>

      <p>She was from a small mountain town near Kingston but had moved to Montego Bay to work. After fifteen minutes of talking, we crossed the street to a casino, then a corner shop for rum, chasers, and beer. This wasn’t a tourist spot—it was raw, real. Locals watched curious, but welcoming.</p>

      <p>Jovel opened up about her life — leaving her son in the countryside, losing his father to violence, fighting to support her family.  
      <em>“Mi haffi do weh mi can fi mek it work.”</em>  
      She’d been suspended from her call-center job that day, which explained her guarded tone. But as the rum flowed, so did her smiles — each one bright enough to light the night.</p>

      <p>Then four pickup trucks rolled up, loaded with armed police. “Jus’ cool,” Jovel whispered. “Dem deh jus’ do di checks.” I raised my hands as an officer approached.  
      “Yuh American?” he asked. I nodded. He glanced at my passport and waved us off.</p>

      <p>“Yuh good now,” Jovel said calmly. “Dem always deh round yah.” It was clear this wasn’t her first time dealing with it.</p>

      <p class="italic text-bone-50/70">
        That night stayed with me — the street light glow, her laugh, the feeling of being seen in a place that wasn’t mine yet felt like home.
