        The air upstairs is thick with the kind of energy that pulls you in, whether you’re ready or not. As we climb the stairs, the faint sounds of moans and laughter from earlier become clearer, sharper. By the time we reach the top, it’s as if we’ve crossed into another world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room is alive, a symphony of passion playing out before me. Bodies intertwined, the heat radiating off them like a living, breathing organism. I stand there, frozen—not out of fear, but awe. This is surreal, like I’ve stepped into some kind of fever dream, the kind of story that feels too wild to retell but too unforgettable to keep to myself. From the club to meeting Joe, to this… whatever this is, it feels like I’ve stumbled into a travel story for the ages.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="my-6 p-5 bg-ink-800/60 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <p class="italic">
          Jo doesn’t hesitate. She kneels between the woman’s thighs like it’s second nature, burying her face there without preamble. The sounds that follow—sucking, slurping, the wet smack of lips and tongue—are impossible to ignore. She eats this woman like a starved predator.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I can feel my body responding, the tension in my pants becoming undeniable. My hands betray me, slipping down to adjust myself, and that’s when Jo notices. Her eyes catch mine, sharp and knowing. She pauses, leaving her friend trembling on the couch, and starts walking toward me, slow and deliberate. She never breaks eye contact, her gaze locking me in place as she crosses the room, still glistening from her earlier escapade.
      </p>

      <p>
        <mark class="bg-ember-500/20 text-ember-300 ring-1 ring-ember-500/30 rounded px-1">
          This is unreal, I think to myself, my mind spinning. Nobody back home will believe this. Hell, I’m not sure I believe it, and I’m living it.
        </mark>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After what feels like forever, she pulls back, her lips leaving me with a final kiss. Her eyes meet mine again, and she asks, “You ready to leave?” Her voice is steady, casual, like she hasn’t just turned my entire world upside down. I hesitate, glancing around at the chaos, but she doesn’t wait for my answer. “Let’s go,” she says, tugging me toward the door.
      </p>

      <p class="italic text-bone-50/70">
        The night hadn’t let go of us. It clung to my skin, thick in my breath, tangled in the charged silence between us as we slid into the backseat.
      </p>

            <p>
        The car pulled up to a roadside food stall—far from the tourist-heavy strips, deep in the city’s heartbeat. Smoke curled from oil drums, thick with the scent of pimento, charred meat, and the sharp sting of Scotch bonnet peppers. The air was sticky-hot, thick with voices and music, basslines shaking the ground beneath us.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second we pulled up to the Airbnb, the mood shifted. “Five t’ousand,” the driver said, leaning against the hood. Jovel’s posture changed instantly. She inhaled slow, deep—too deep. The kind of breath you take when you’re deciding whether to let something slide or burn it all the way down.
      </p>
      
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-ember-500/70 pl-4 italic text-bone-50/80">
        “Mi pay yuh di same ting every time,” she said, voice low and dangerous. The tension snapped. Fast patois, sharp as a blade, slicing through the air like gunfire. <strong class="text-ember-400">“Bloodclaat!”</strong> Jovel ripped the bills from her purse, slapped them against his chest, and turned away.
      </blockquote>

            <p>
        Hunger dragged us sideways to a roadside drum. The cook smirked at Jovel. <strong class="text-ember-400">“Yuh late tonight.”</strong> Jovel dipped a finger in pepper sauce and pressed it to my lips. Sweet first. Then the slow blaze. I swallowed, jaw locked. She laughed like she already knew I’d refuse to fold.
      </p>

            <div class="my-8 h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-ember-500/40 to-transparent"></div>
      
      <p>
        Back inside, we barely made it to the bathroom. She pushed me back first. My spine hit the tile, water running over my shoulders as she sank to her knees. I grabbed her wrists, flipped the moment on her. Had her against the wall now, water streaming down her body. We didn’t rush. We learned the language the night had been teaching us.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span class="inline-block px-2 py-1 rounded bg-ember-600/20 text-ember-300 ring-1 ring-ember-500/30">
          I devoured her. Starved. Deprived. I savored her like a tasting menu at a Michelin-star restaurant.
        </span>
      </p>
      
      <p class="italic text-bone-50/70">
        After the slow, teasing buildup, I went deeper, faster, harder, pushing her to that place where her pleasure stopped being soft and pretty and became something raw and desperate.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When we moved to the main event, we switched positions, reversed, tangled, untangled, reconnected. Animalistic. Instinctive. We found the rhythm—the sound, the rhythm, the band.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="my-8 p-6 bg-ink-800/60 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <p class="text-xl italic">
          <strong class="text-ember-400">“Cum for me, wicked girl.”</strong> Her voice broke. <em class="text-bone-50/70">“Breed mi—deep—choke mi—”</em> That was it. I snapped my hips into her. She screamed.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
        <mark class="bg-ember-500/20 text-ember-300 ring-1 ring-ember-500/30 rounded px-1">
          “Told you I wasn’t stopping till you begged.” She laughed, soft, spent, still catching her breath. And then she reached for me—and I knew she wasn’t done yet.
        </mark>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I pressed her harder against the wall, angling myself deeper, and when I thrust, it wasn’t slow anymore. She choked on a gasp. Then a moan. Then my name—over and over. Her body was still trembling against mine, her skin damp, heat lingering between us, like the moment refused to let go. Spent. Satisfied. Mine.
      </p>

            <div class="my-8 h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-ember-500/40 to-transparent"></div>
      <p>
        I woke up with my head still buzzing. Jovel was sprawled on the couch, naked, legs folded beneath her, rolling a spliff with slow, practiced ease. The early afternoon light spilled over her deep brown skin, turning her into something golden.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<em class="text-bone-50/80">Mawnin’</em>,” she murmured, voice thick with sleep. I answered, and the room warmed again. We talked about home—mine fractured, hers rooted. I told her how it felt to land in a place where everyone looked like me.
      </p>
      
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-ember-500/70 pl-4 italic text-bone-50/80">
        She studied me. “Mi grow up seein’ mi face reflected everywhere. Mi skin color normal here. But mi know dat nuh true fi everybody.” She paused. <strong class="text-ember-400">“Di real Jamaica is a survivor.”</strong>
      </blockquote>

            <p>
        She returned with escoveitch snapper—crisp skin, vinegar bright as a bell, peppers singing lead. Rice and peas, cabbage, plantain. I took a bite and could only say, “Damn.”
      </p>

            <div class="my-8 h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-ember-500/40 to-transparent"></div>
      <p>
        The hill into town was all heat and shouting brakes. Montego Bay met us with vendors, basslines, and the perfume of fried dough. The city saw her. A deep, gravelly voice called out from across the street: <strong class="text-ember-400">“Fimi!”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jovel didn’t slow. She traded jokes, paid Miss Patsy, stole a mango smile from the fruit man. The name followed her like a chorus. “So… <em class="text-bone-50/80">Fimi</em>,” I tested. She side-eyed me, grin tucked away. <em class="text-bone-50/80">“Yuh haffi earn dat.”</em>
      </p>

            <p>
        At Miss Ling’s, steam rose from bowls built to fix the soul — chicken soup with extra spinners. <strong class="text-ember-400">“Mi nuh water down seasoning fi nobody,”</strong> she warned. We laughed because the truth tasted good.
      </p>

            <p>
        She flagged a route taxi and the city blurred into an upstairs shop — clippers buzzing, children weaving, cats sun-drunk in doorways. A stylist combed my roots and nodded like a verdict. “Mi fix dis up proper.”
      </p>
      
      <p class="italic text-bone-50/70">
        I watched Jovel at the window, silhouette cut from light. The city didn’t just belong to her. It answered when she called.
      </p>

            <blockquote class="my-8 p-6 bg-ink-800/60 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <p class="text-xl italic">
          <strong class="text-ember-400">“Yuh not from yah, eh?”</strong>
          He grinned. “Mi coulda tell. Di way yuh siddung quiet. Americans always quiet ‘til dem get comfortable.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>

            <p>
        By evening, the day had stitched itself into me — pepper heat, roadside smoke, a city that renamed us both. I didn’t know how long I’d stay. I only knew I wasn’t done listening.
