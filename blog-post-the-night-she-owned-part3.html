        Upstairs, the air changed. Music thinned to a heartbeat while laughter blurred into a hush. It felt like stepping through a curtain — into a room where <em>want</em> had its own weather.

      <blockquote class="my-6 p-5 bg-ink-800/60 border border-white/10 rounded-xl">

          Jo glanced back with that half-dangerous smile. <strong class="text-ember-400">“Yuh feel it?”</strong> she whispered. <em>“Follow mi.”</em>
        </p>

      <p>
        The night didn’t rush us. It unfolded. Fingers laced, breath close, a slow choreography of courage and invitation. We didn’t need instructions — just the rhythm already moving through our bodies.
      </p>

      <p>
        <mark class="bg-ember-500/20 text-ember-300 ring-1 ring-ember-500/30 rounded px-1">
          Some doors you open with a key. Others open because you finally stop pretending you don’t want what’s behind them.
        </mark>

      <!-- CUTAWAY / FADE -->
      <div class="my-8 h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-ember-500/40 to-transparent"></div>

      <!-- DRIVER / TENSION -->
      <p>
        By the time we hit the street again, the night had shifted from velvet to iron. At the Airbnb, the driver leaned on his hood, lips tight. “<em>Five t’ousand.</em>”
      </p>
      <p>
        Jo inhaled slow, measuring the fire. “Every time mi pay yuh di same,” she said, voice low enough to cut. Bills slapped his chest, sharp as flint. The moment cracked — and the city exhaled with us.
      </p>

      <!-- FOOD STALL -->
      <p>
        Hunger dragged us sideways to a roadside drum. Smoke rose like a hymn — pimento, sweet heat, steel on cutting board. The cook smirked at Jo. <em>“Yuh late tonight.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jo dipped a finger in pepper sauce and pressed it to my lips, eyes bright with dare. Sweet first. Then the slow blaze. I swallowed, jaw locked. She laughed like she already knew I’d refuse to fold.
      </p>

      <!-- FADE-TO-BLACK INTIMACY -->
      <div class="my-8 h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-ember-500/40 to-transparent"></div>
      <p>
        Back inside, steam gathered on tile and mirror. We learned the language the night had been teaching us — one breath at a time. No witnesses. No rush. Just the kind of silence that leaves a mark.
      </p>
      <p class="italic text-bone-50/70">
        There are scenes the page doesn’t need. The body remembers them anyway.
      </p>

      <!-- MORNING AFTER -->
      <div class="my-8 h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-ember-500/40 to-transparent"></div>
      <p>
        Morning slid in on the TV’s low murmur. Jo curled on the couch, rolling a spliff with the patience of a tide. Sunlight climbed her skin into gold. She felt me looking.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<em>Mawnin’.</em>” A lazy smirk. I answered, and the room warmed again.
      </p>

      <p>
        We talked about home — mine fractured, hers rooted. I told her how it felt to land in a place where everyone looked like me. She nodded like she was mapping a constellation I only just noticed.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-ember-500/70 pl-4 italic text-bone-50/80">
        “Di real Jamaica is a survivor,” she said. “We loud when we happy. Loud when we vex. We feel everything.”
      </blockquote>

      <!-- ESCOVEITCH / MEAL -->
      <p>
        She came back with escoveitch snapper — crisp skin, vinegar bright as a bell, peppers singing lead. Rice and peas, cabbage, plantain. I took a bite and could only say, “Damn.”
      </p>

          Some meals are more than food. They are permission.
        </span>

      <!-- WALK INTO CITY / “FIMI” -->
      <div class="my-8 h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-ember-500/40 to-transparent"></div>
      <p>
        The hill into town was all heat and shouting brakes. Montego Bay met us with vendors, basslines, and the perfume of fried dough. Voices bloomed from doorways:
        <strong class="text-ember-400">“Fimi!”</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jo didn’t slow. She traded jokes, paid Miss Patsy, stole a mango smile from the fruit man. The name followed her like a chorus.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So… <em>Fimi</em>,” I tested. She side-eyed me, grin tucked away. “<em>Yuh haffi earn dat.</em>”
      </p>

      <!-- SOUP / MISS LING -->
      <p>
        At Miss Ling’s, steam rose from bowls built to fix the soul — chicken soup with extra spinners. “Mi nuh water down seasoning fi nobody,” she warned. We laughed because the truth tasted good.
      </p>

      <!-- BARBER / HAIR -->
      <p>
        Jo flagged a route taxi and the city blurred into an upstairs shop — clippers buzzing, children weaving, cats sun-drunk in doorways. A stylist combed my roots and nodded like a verdict. “Mi fix dis up proper.”
      </p>
      <p class="italic text-bone-50/70">
        I watched Jo at the window, silhouette cut from light. The city didn’t just belong to her. It answered when she called.
      </p>

      </blockquote>

      <!-- CLOSE -->
      <p>
        By evening, the day had stitched itself into me — pepper heat, roadside smoke, a city that renamed us both. I didn’t know how long I’d stay. I only knew I wasn’t done listening.
