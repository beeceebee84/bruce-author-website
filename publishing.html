        The <span class="text-[#D9822B]">BKR Imprint</span> Story
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The <strong>BKR</strong> Imprint emerged from frustration with a broken system—one filled with opaque jargon,
        inflated costs, and relentless pressure to reshape your story to fit a predetermined mold. When I set out to publish
        my first book, I refused to compromise the truth of my work. Instead, I mastered the process—professional design,
        seamless distribution, and independent publishing done right.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">That experience became our foundation.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        BKR is a space for every creator—whether you’re publishing your first book or your tenth—who demands both high
        quality and complete creative control. We handle the complexity of the back-end publishing process, providing expert
        guidance in editing, layout, ISBN management, and global distribution, so you can stay focused on what matters most:
        your art.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re not just a service; we’re a partner dedicated to your success. Every book we help publish receives the same care
        and respect we give our own. Our mission is simple: to help creators bring their stories into the world with confidence
        and the professional polish their work deserves.
